      <p>
        At this point, if you were considering more than two dimensions, you
        would be asked to weight the relative importance of those dimensions
        on a scale. But, since you've listed
        <% if @decision_problem.dimensions.count == 1 %>
          one dimension, there's no need for providing this scale ranking.
        <% else %>
          two dimensions, the rankings you provided in the previous step are
          sufficient.
        <% end %>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you decide to go back and add more dimensions, you'll be asked to
        rank them here. Otherwise, feel free to move on!
